This is my personal web blog programmed using PHP 5 and MySQL.

The IDE i'm using for development is Eclipse with PHP Development Tools.

Since this is a Game Programming Blog it has some features that makes it a rich tool for blog creation.

It has:

- Login system - Access security levels - Forum capabilities - Project Planning - News - Articles - On-line tutorials - On-line classes -

Some more features will be added during development...
